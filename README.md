Source code for Beer Locker tutorials

####beerlocker-1

With an ever growing collection of beer, I am in dire need of a way to store and track my beer. What better way to do this than to create an application where I can add, remove, update, and view my beer collection. Like any motivated developer, I want my friends to be able to create their own lockers and control who has access to mine.

In this multipart series weâ€™ll be creating a RESTful API using Node, Express, Mongoose to interact with MongoDB, Passport for authentication, OAuth2orize for OAuth support, and explore best practices and tools.

When we are done, we should have an API that allows users to authenticate, perform CRUD operations, authorize other applications via OAuth to access the API, have a solid understanding of best practices and tooling, and most important of all, a place to store our beer!

In our previous article we left off with a basic Node applicaton in place capable of accepting HTTP requests and responding back with some static JSON.

In this part we will dive a bit deeper and learn how to implement CRUD operations on our beer locker. By the end of this article you will have learned how to connect to a MongoDB, used Mongoose for object modeling, and have implemented GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE endpoints.
